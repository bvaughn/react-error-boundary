# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `npm run setup -s` to install dependencies and run validation
3. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
